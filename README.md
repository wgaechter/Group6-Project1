# Group6-Project1

# This project checks to see how does the pandemic known by many names but most common is Covid-19.
# Effect different industries is there a corolation from cases to sales for these industries.

# In this project we have two pieces of data string.
# One which we call the MainData, which has the covid cases per day in NYC,
# and percentages changes for different industries, such as restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacy, and general retail.
# The other is know as MTAData which has turns style data for the subways and how Covid-19 effected travel within NYC.

# To ensure success we cleaned the data and filter out the Covid-19 data to the five counties that creates New York City.
# We also did the same to the industry data and turnstyle data.

# Once the information was clean we then merged the covid 19 data set and the industry data set together to create a graph for each industry.
# This was also done for the turnstyle data.

# Once compared we looked at the data to see if there are any trends with the data or corolations that covid-19 cases have on these different data sets.

# Three observations

    # Observation One,
	# Covid-19 does have an affect on industries the higher the cases the less people buy and vise versa.
    # Observation Two,
	# With the rise in Covid-19 cases seems to keep people at home more as the turnstyles increase at suburbe locations, or high density housing locations.
    # Obersvation Three,
	# The cause of the reaction to cases cannot be determined as people are either changing there behavior due to restrictions, or the increase in activity could be causing the increase in cases and not the other way around.

# Group6-Project1---Back to Normal? Analyzing the affect covid-19 cases has had on the residents of NYC
# Overview 
Our group wanted to see how the rise and fall in new covid 19 cases affected everday, normal trends of New York City residents. We started by getting data for the new number of covid-19 cases daily in the NYC metro area. We then attempted to grab "normal" trend data by looking at the number of reservations made at NYC restarants, subway use, and mobility reports. Merging all of those data sets together we were able to plot how new covid 19 cases has influenced NYC life from Febuary to October. Check out our presentation for further insights!
